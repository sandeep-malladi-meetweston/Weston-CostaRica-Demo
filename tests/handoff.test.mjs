/* Spec §7 — the bridge between the two surfaces.
 *
 * Both files are opened from disk with no server, so the handoff is browser
 * storage plus the `storage` event: `sessionStorage` for the case state of the
 * one interactive case, `localStorage` for the live cross-tab message bridge.
 * The mechanism is the Spanish demo's, carried over rather than reinvented.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and are asserted here before anything else:
 *
 *   1. lender.html is demoable alone. Empty, malformed or future-version storage
 *      all give a complete twelve-loan board from the built-in fixture. A parse
 *      error never blanks the page.
 *   2. Restart is honest. After restart on the borrower side the shared thread is
 *      empty on both sides, and no message of a previous run can reappear —
 *      while a message written *after* the restart still arrives.
 *
 * There is no DOM here, so storage is a double: a memory map whose `setItem` can
 * be replaced with one that throws, which is how the quota path is really
 * exercised rather than assumed.
