/* BancoBCR English portal — the shared case state engine.
 *
 * One state shape, one set of transitions, both surfaces. The borrower page and
 * the lender page never reach into each other: they hand this module a state and
 * take a new state back, and the handoff in §7 is nothing more than that state
 * crossing browser storage.
 *
 * The rules this file lives by, from spec §4.4 and the reference
 * silverhill-workspace.js it is modelled on:
 *
 *   - Every transition is pure. It takes a state, returns a NEW state, and
 *     returns the *input object itself* when the transition does not apply —
 *     unknown id, blank text, a verdict that is not a verdict, an already
 *     resolved item, an invalid timestamp. Callers can therefore compare by
 *     reference to know whether anything happened.
 *   - No clock and no randomness. Ids come from `nextSequence`; timestamps are
 *     always explicit arguments. That is what makes the suite deterministic.
 *   - No DOM. This file is loaded and tested on its own, with no copy layer in
 *     the context, so it stores no English prose it invented: the `summary` of
 *     an item it raises itself is the copy key `review.<type>`, and the renderer
 *     puts it through `FalabellaCopy.t()`. Free text that a human or another
 *     system produced — a message, a filename, a condition — is data and is
 *     stored verbatim.
 *   - Review work never moves the stage. `deriveStage` reads workflow
 *     milestones and document verdicts, never the review queue.
 *   - Approval is derived from cleared conditions, never from elapsed time.
